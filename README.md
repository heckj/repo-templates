# üñºÔ∏è üìÑ Swift Repository Templates üñºÔ∏è üìÑ

Helpful file templates and guidance for repositories in /swiftlang. Project maintainers should use this guidance for the root files of every repository. 

## üåê Org Level 

/swiftlang provides some documents at the organization level .github folder that powers consistency across all repositories. Read more general information about GitHub Org Level Files [here](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file)

The project has implemented the following files at the org level would need a special exception from the Core Team in order to opt-out:
- CONDUCT.md
- SECURITY.md

## üè† Repo Level 

The following files are required in each repo and are not set at Org level:
- LICENSE
- README.md
- CONTRIBUTORS.txt
- CONTRIBUTING.md** (only if there are custom processes, environment set up instructions, or the repo needs more instructions than whats on the README) 


.github templates:
- codeowners
- pull request template
- issue template


**this file can be present at the .github org level but it does not have the same distribution benefits as other files so repo level is required
