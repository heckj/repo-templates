# Swift Repository Templates

Helpful file templates and guidance for repositories in /swiftlang. Project maintainers should use this guidance for the root files of every repository. 

## Org Level 

/swiftlang provides some documents at the organization level .github folder that powers consistency across all repositories. 

The below files are provided and would need a special exception from the Core Team in order to opt-out:
- SECURITY.md
- CONDUCT.md

[Read more general information about GitHub Org Level Files here]


## Repo Level 

The following files are required in each repo and are not set at Org level:
- CONTRIBUTING.md*
- LICENSE
- README.md 

.github templates:
- codeowners
- pull request template
- issue template


* this file can be present at the .github org level but it does not have the same distribution benefits as other files so repo level is required
